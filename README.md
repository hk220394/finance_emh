# Finance EMH

Finance experts often caution against trying to time the market, claiming it's irresponsible and unlikely to succeed. However, with the advent of machine learning, is it now worth attempting to time the market?

The **Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH)** posits that all knowable information is already reflected in stock prices, making it nearly impossible to consistently outperform the market. But how true is that theory in today's data-driven landscape?

## Project Overview

This repository explores the limits of market efficiency by using a combination of public and proprietary daily market data to build predictive models. Our goal is to:

- **Predict excess returns** using machine learning
- **Design a trading strategy** that stays within a specified risk limit
- **Evaluate the validity of EMH** in the context of modern financial data

Your work will directly test the Efficient Market Hypothesis and challenge longstanding assumptions about market efficiency.

## Key Features

- Data ingestion and preprocessing from multiple market sources
- Feature engineering for financial time series
- Model training and evaluation (machine learning methods)
- Backtesting trading strategies with risk controls
- EMH hypothesis testing and analysis
